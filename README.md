# WALMART-SALES-ANALYSIS

Objective: This project aims to understand what influences sales at different Walmart branches.

Analysis List:
1. Product Analysis: Look at the types of products sold, identify top-performing product lines, and find areas for improvement.
2. Sales Analysis: Study sales trends to evaluate the effectiveness of different sales strategies and identify areas for improvement.
3. Customer Analysis: Analyze customer segments, buying patterns, and profitability.

Approach Used:
1. Data Wrangling: Check the data for any missing values and fill them in if needed. No missing values were found in this project.
2. Feature Engineering: Create new categories based on existing data to gain more insights. For example, categorize sales by time of day (morning, afternoon, evening), day of the week, and month of the year.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Dig into the data to answer the questions and goals of the project.
